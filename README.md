# TheBoys Twitter Popularity and Sentiment Analysis
## Introduction and Inspiration

Since The Boys came out it was a top show that captivated me from the first 5 minutes. Every year a new season would come out and I would watch it because it had all the elements of a great show. Suspense, drama, betrayal and the works. I wasn't the only one who saw it this way because I logged on to Twitter and saw everyone talking about The Boys and honest to God I was a Twitter addict. So when I began thinking about personal projects and dashboards to create I wanted it to feel personal. I was recently fascinated by a sentiment analysis I saw by The Numerist; a data analyst I frequented her YouTube videos. She did a sentiment analysis on Love Island which other blog posts featured because of the accuracy of her predictions from the sentiment analysis. Now this wasn't a game show like Love Island but I wanted to do a project so why not use the path of her idea for a show I felt strongly about as she did? 

## Findings
1. Although the finale aired at 8:00 am, the Twitter presence of company hashtags did not peak until about 7:00 pm on the 8th. Twitter's presence then dwindled but remained between 200 and 400 tweets per hour for the rest of the weekend.
2. Our top trending hashtag apart from #TheBoys and #TheBoysFinale was #TheBoysTV. The top trending hashtag unrelated to the show was  #ThorLoveAndThunder. #internetdown was also a highly recurring hashtag, indicating servers may have slowed down or crashed on the release date due to heavy traffic
3. Homelander was the only character in our top 15 keywords for this social media season.  The only non-English words (2) in the top 15 are Spanish, this implies we have a high demographic of Spanish-speaking viewers.
4. Our top tweeting location is New York, USA and Brazil and India are the only locations in the top 5 not within the USA.

## Recommendations
1. Ensure Homelander remains a relevant character with sufficient screentime and lines that continue the progression of his character arcs.
2. Ensure servers are well optimized and scaled up for heavy traffic streaming on release dates and times.
3. Include the possibility of an official Spanish dubbed version of the show to increase the already high interest of Spanish-speaking viewers.
